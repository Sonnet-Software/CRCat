    Begin electromagnetic simulation using frequency sweep:
      Exponential Start = 0.01, Stop = 100, Number = 1000 GHZ

    Frequency:  0.01 GHZ

      Sonnet Warning:
      Potential problem with box parameter.
      The X cell size (0.1 mm) is greater than
      1/20 wavelength (0.063916 mm) at 100 GHz.
      You must decrease the cell size or reduce the required number
      of subsections per wavelength to resolve this conflict.
